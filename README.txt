Columns 3-14 are names as “X” + total CFUS. Figure 2A.Data_table_s3.txt : Dilution plating data for male and female flies injected with various optical densities (OD) of ilux-Ecoli . Columns 1-7 are self descriptive. Column 8=“DF”: Dilution Factor. Columns 9-11= technical replicates for quantification of CFUs. Figure 2B.Data_table_s4.txt: Corresponding flux data for the flies in Data_table_s3.txt. Figure 2B.Data_table_s5.txt:Dilution plating data for male flies injected with various optical densities (OD) of ilux-Ecoli . Columns 1-5 are self descriptive. Column 6 =“DF”: Dilution Factor. Columns 7-9= technical replicates for quantification of CFUs. Figure 2B.Data_table_s6.txt:Corresponding flux data for the flies in Data_table_s5.txt. Figure 2B.Data_table_s7.txt: Longitudinal flux data for flies injected with various OD’s of ilux-ecoli. Column “p_CFU”: predicted CFUs, this column corresponds with the OD injected. Figure 3.Data_table_s8.txt: CFU data for measuring plasmid loss. 1 of 2 data setsData_table_s9.txt:CFU data for measuring plasmid loss. 2 of 2 data setsData_table_s10.txt:Flux data for flies infected with OD=6  (CFUs = 684172), imaged every half hour for 12 hours. Column 1 “Well”:  Row name on the 96 well plate used for imaging. Columns 4-16 : “Fly”+ the column number of the fly in each plate, ie “Fly2” is the second column of the 96well plate. Figure 4.Data_table_s11.txt:Corresponding death data for Data_table_s10.txtData_table_s12.txt:Flux data for flies infected with OD=.06  (CFUs = 6841), imaged every hour for +48 hours. Column 1 “Well”:  Row name on the 96 well plate used for imaging. Columns 6-17 : “Fly”+ the column number of the fly in each plate, ie “Fly02” is the second column of the 96well plate.
